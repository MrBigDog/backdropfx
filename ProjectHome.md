**This project is under development and not yet ready for public release.**

# What is backdropFX? #
BackdropFX is a OpenGL GLSL shader based rendering engine for OSG based applications to help with the migration to non-FFP based applications. Unfortunately this project ran into a number of performance limitations due to 3rd party library design deficiencies which resulted in the project being shelved for the past 2-3 years. In the near future development should begin on the migration of backdropFX to OpenGL 3 + 4.

# Who should use backdropFX? #
An application developer who is interested in using an extensible render effects pipeline for various shader based effects.

# Who should _not_ use backdropFX? #
An application developer who is looking for a one line drop API for rendering effects. This library is built to give developers flexibility in working with shader based effects.
